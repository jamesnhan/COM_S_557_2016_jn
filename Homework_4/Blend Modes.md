#Blending Mode Differences

I used two different blending modes.

1. 33%, 33$, 33$ of each of the three textures.
2. 10% color, 100%, 100%, 100% of each of the three textures.

Both blending modes were done additively. The result of the first blending mode had a slightly dark, but decent result. This blending mode simulated a 33% alpha blending value on each of the textures.

The result of the second blending mode had a very, very white appearance due to the fact that it simply added all three textures together with the background color and did not use the alpha values at all.
